# Coverage System

The coverage subsystem fetches code-coverage metrics from Jenkins' [Code Coverage API](https://plugins.jenkins.io/code-coverage-api/) plugin and surfaces them at three levels in the Gerrit UI:

1. **Line-level annotations** — green (COVERED) / red (NOT_COVERED) highlights in the diff view.
2. **File-list columns** — per-file line, branch and instruction coverage (whole file) plus line coverage of new lines (`Cov(L) | Cov(B) | Cov(I) | ΔCov(L)`).
3. **Checks tab verdict** — a `Code Coverage` check run grading the change's own lines, followed by the project statistics as context and per-file alerts.

## Endpoints

Three Jenkins REST endpoints are queried in parallel:

| Endpoint | Response class | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `{statusLink}{coverage_id}/api/json` | `io.jenkins.plugins.coverage.metrics.restapi.CoverageApi` | Project-level stats, per-file delta percentages |
| `{statusLink}{coverage_id}/modified/api/json` | `io.jenkins.plugins.coverage.metrics.restapi.ModifiedLinesCoverageApi` | Per-file modified line blocks with coverage types |
| `{statusLink}{coverage_id}/files/api/json` | `io.jenkins.plugins.coverage.metrics.restapi.FileCoverageApi` | Per-file whole-file (absolute) coverage of modified files |

`{coverage_id}` is the Jenkins Coverage plugin report id (default `coverage`), configurable per Jenkins instance via the `coverage_id` config key.

All three are fetched **per completed attempt** on the change's patchset. The `files` endpoint is newer than the other two and returns `404` on older Coverage plugin versions; the frontend treats that as "no absolute coverage" rather than an error.

## Finding completed runs

Before fetching coverage data, `CoverageClient.findCompletedRuns()` queries:

```
GET {jenkins}/gerrit-checks/runs?change={changeNum}&patchset={patchNum}
```

It returns every run with `status === "COMPLETED"` (sorted newest-attempt first). Each attempt has its own `statusLink`, and coverage is fetched per attempt from that link — so a replayed build shows its own coverage row instead of pointing at a stale link. The `(statusLink, attempt)` pair is the staleness key for cache invalidation (see [caching.md](caching.md)).

## Data parsing

### `parseRanges()` — line-level annotation data

Input: `ModifiedLinesResponse` with `files[].modifiedLinesBlocks[]`.

Each block has:

```typescript
interface ModifiedLinesBlock {
    startLine: number;
    endLine: number;
    type: string;   // "COVERED", "MISSED", etc.
}
```

Blocks are mapped to Gerrit's `CoverageRange`:

```typescript
{
    side: Side.RIGHT,                               // always RIGHT (the new patchset)
    type: block.type === 'COVERED'
        ? CoverageType.COVERED
        : CoverageType.NOT_COVERED,
    code_range: {
        start_line: block.startLine,
        end_line: block.endLine,
    },
}
```

Result is keyed by `fullyQualifiedFileName` — the absolute path within the repository.

### `computePercentages()` — per-file percentage data

Input: same `ModifiedLinesResponse`.

The modified-lines endpoint only reports lines changed by this CL, so the
computed value is the **incremental** coverage of new/changed lines, not the
whole-file absolute coverage.

For each file, counts covered vs missed lines across all blocks:

```
covered = Σ (block.endLine - block.startLine + 1)  for blocks where type === 'COVERED'
missed  = Σ (block.endLine - block.startLine + 1)  for all other blocks
total   = covered + missed

if total > 0:
    incremental = Math.round((covered / total) * 100)
```

Returns `{ [path]: { incremental: number } }`.

### `computePatchCoverage()` — aggregate coverage of the change

Input: same `ModifiedLinesResponse`.

Line-weighted aggregate over every modified-line block of every file:

```
covered = Σ (block.endLine - block.startLine + 1)  for blocks where type === 'COVERED'
missed  = Σ (block.endLine - block.startLine + 1)  for all other blocks
total   = covered + missed

pct = total > 0 ? Math.round((covered / total) * 100) : undefined
```

Because it sums over lines rather than averaging the per-file percentages, a 3-line file at 0% plus a 300-line file at 100% aggregates to 99%, not 50%. `pct` is undefined when the change touched no instrumented lines at all (docs-only, pure rename, pure deletion) — distinct from a `pct` of 0, which means every touched line is untested.

Returns `{ covered, missed, total, pct }`. This is the figure the check run is classified on (see [Low-coverage alert](#low-coverage-alert)); the per-file `incremental` percentages are not aggregated into it.

### `computeAbsolutePercentages()` — per-file absolute coverage

Input: `FileCoverageResponse` from `{coverage_id}/files/api/json`, with `files[].metrics` mapping metric names to formatted percentages (e.g. `{"line": "88.44%", "branch": "82.19%", "instruction": "98.36%"}`).

For each file, the `line`, `branch` and `instruction` metrics are parsed with `parsePct()`:

```
absolute = parsePct(metrics["line"])
absolute_branch = parsePct(metrics["branch"])
absolute_instruction = parsePct(metrics["instruction"])
```

Returns `{ [path]: { absolute, absolute_branch, absolute_instruction } }`, setting only the metrics that are present.

`updateCache()` merges the incremental and absolute maps so each path carries all fields in a single `PercentageData` object, and stores the change-level `computePatchCoverage()` aggregate on the cache entry alongside them.

## Low-coverage alert

`mayBeShowLowCoverageAlert()` runs as part of the unified checks provider. It emits one `Code Coverage` check run per completed attempt, each with a `statusLink` to that attempt's coverage report. Within a run, results are ordered patch-verdict-first, then the project statistics as context, then per-file alerts:

```typescript
const PATCH_COVERAGE_WARNING_BAR = 70;
```

The bar applies to the lines a change modifies, never to the project as a whole: an absolute bar on the project would flag every change to a project that sits below it, however well the change itself is tested.

### Patch verdict (first line)

The cached `patchCoverage` aggregate — see `computePatchCoverage()` above — decides the run's severity through `classifyPatchCoverage()`:

| Condition | Category |
|---|---|
| `pct` undefined — the change touched no instrumented lines | `INFO` |
| `pct` ≥ 70% | `INFO` |
| `pct` < 70%, `Low-Coverage-Reason` present | `INFO` |
| `pct` < 70%, no reason | `WARNING` |

The result links to the overall report at `{statusLink}{coverage_id}` and reads either

```
"🔴 Patch coverage 41% — 12 of 29 modified lines are not covered by tests"
```

followed by the *add tests / add `Low-Coverage-Reason`* message, or

```
"📊 Patch coverage: 92% — 46 of 50 modified lines covered"
```

### Project statistics (context)

When `projectStatistics` is present, the run continues with the global project coverage, with each metric's change vs the reference build appended from `projectDelta`:

```
"📊 Project coverage: Line: 🟢 88.44% (+5.70%), Branch: 🟢 82.19% (+3.33%), File: 🟢 100.00% (+3.46%), Class: 🟢 96.88% (+6.86%)"
```

This result is always `INFO` — it describes the tree the change lands in rather than the change itself — and links to the same overall report. When the change modified files but none of them carry instrumented lines, *"No instrumented lines in this change."* is appended to the message. When `projectDelta` is absent, the deltas are simply omitted; the `Loc` delta (`ΔLoc`) is appended to the result message.

### Per-file alerts

For every file with coverage data, if `incremental < PATCH_COVERAGE_WARNING_BAR`:

- **Without `Low-Coverage-Reason`**: emits a `WARNING` result with message *"Please add tests for uncovered lines or add Low-Coverage-Reason in commit message."*
- **With `Low-Coverage-Reason`**: demotes to `INFO` with message *"Low-Coverage-Reason provided — CL will not be blocked."*

Each per-file alert links to that file's coverage report at `{statusLink}{coverage_id}/{javaStringHashCode(file)}/`.

### Fallback

When an attempt carries per-file coverage but none of the results above fired — nothing instrumented, no project statistics and no per-file alert — a single `INFO` result naming how many modified files carry coverage data is emitted, so the attempt still surfaces its coverage link.

### Quality gates

The `qualityGates` field (with `overallResult` and per-gate `resultItems`) from the coverage API response is available but not currently surfaced in the UI.

## `Low-Coverage-Reason` footer

Commit messages can include a footer to suppress low-coverage warnings:

```
Low-Coverage-Reason: HARD_TO_TEST
```

### Parsing

```typescript
const re = /Low-Coverage-Reason:(.*)/g;
const matches = [...commitMessage.matchAll(re)];
```

Takes the first match (global, multi-line) and trims the value.

### Valid prefixes

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TRIVIAL_CHANGE` | Minimal logic change, not worth testing |
| `TESTS_ARE_DISABLED` | Tests exist but are temporarily disabled |
| `TESTS_IN_SEPARATE_CL` | Tests will be added in a follow-up change |
| `HARD_TO_TEST` | The change is inherently difficult to test |
| `COVERAGE_UNDERREPORTED` | Coverage tool misses lines that are actually exercised |
| `LARGE_SCALE_REFACTOR` | Behavior-preserving restructuring |
| `EXPERIMENTAL_CODE` | Prototype or experimental change |
| `OTHER` | None of the above (provide details after prefix) |

### Format check

If a `Low-Coverage-Reason` footer exists but does **not** start with one of the valid prefixes, a separate `Low-Coverage-Reason Format Check` warning run is emitted. This doesn't block the change but alerts the author.

## Column visibility gating

`showPercentageColumns()` returns `true` only when:

1. The project can be parsed from `window.location.pathname`.
2. A config exists for that project.
3. `coverage_enabled === true` in that config.

When `false`, all 12 dynamic custom components set `shown = false`, hiding them from the file list via CSS class `hidden`.

## Unavailable endpoint tracking

If **both** `coverage/api/json` and `coverage/modified/api/json` return 403, the `coverageUnavailable` flag is set to `true`. From that point, all coverage fetches for the session are skipped — no more HTTP requests are made to the coverage endpoints. This prevents request storms when the Code Coverage API plugin is not installed on Jenkins.
